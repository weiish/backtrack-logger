# backtrack-logger

I wanted to visualize the time I spend on my computer, so I built an application in two parts.

This is the data collection part of the application.
It logs the currently active process/window that the user is using. 

For use in conjunction with Backtrack app that visualizes the collected data for productivity and self time management.
(In case you wanted to know exactly how much time you spent binging netflix, etc. without keeping track yourself)

# For Demo
The built app is in the /dist folder. Just download the whole /dist folder and run backtrack.exe.

# Visualization Part
The visualization part of the app can be found here! https://github.com/weiish/backtrack-electron
